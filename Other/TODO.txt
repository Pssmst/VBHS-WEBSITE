TABLE ------------------------------------

[ ] Fix OR logic flex courses (science or math)
    - Add a conditional to ensure advancedFlexbars[cell.id][0] exists before doing anything (I think that's the problem?)
    - I believe the flexCourse class is not being removed properly from the table cells. Actually, I don't think it's getting deleted at all... anywhere

[ ] Make sure to account for double-blocked courses by seeping down into a unoccupied elective cell and coloring the tile-outline a different color to refer to the double-blocked courses
[ ] Find a way to tackle the Human Body Systems rule lmao (see courses.js)

[ ] Create new div under the table that shows what courses you still need to have to meet the graduation requirement, as well as how many honors credits you have
    - Requirements met by flex credits should be colored golden instead of white

[ ] Automatically delete PAP Algebra 1 off the table if the checkbox is suddenly selected (do this in that one thing that does logic about papalgebra1 or something)
[ ] Let the user pick up and move courses from the table by single-clicking them
[✓] Fix weird course :before element clipping

CATALOG PANEL ------------------------------------

[ ] The stupid '✦' :before pseudo-element doesn't like rotating on its center ONLY on chromebook. It rotates fine on computer...??????? Fix it...
[ ] The stupid '➤' :before pseudo-element also looks weird on chromebook. Fix it...

[ ] Add file export of classes and lines in the scheduler (will require lots of blood, sweat, and tears to do this)
    - Counselors are heavily against any kind of automated access to the catalog or csv-ifying the data, so some real tricky metadata reading will be required

PATHWAYS ------------------------------------

[ ] Overhaul line colors to only be random upon startup, so the user doesn’t get lost in a maze of faulty color-association
[ ] Currently everything is broken (again). Try overhauling the algorithm (again) to fix it :)
[ ] Provide information about classes when hovering over them in the course pathways tab
[ ] Beautify the pathways page with css (match the styling with table cells)

EXTRA (VERY LOW-PRIORITY) ------------------------------------

[ ] Dynamically add and display new properties to the course catalog courses called “teachers” and “room”
[ ] Create “teacher” (textbox) and “room” (dropdown) search filters
[ ] Webscrape photos of staff members from vbhs website using their names from the csv and display their photos when prompted (also display all of them with emails dynamically added using their names in another div probably at the bottom which can be scrolled through (maybe even searched!)
[ ] Also include their course schedules, also taken from the csv file
[ ] Include map of floor 1 and floor 2 of school (made up of several images of the whole map with one room in red; repeat for each room, keep in a “rooms folder,” then display the images dynamically)
[ ] Rooms light up in red when the user hovers over the room on the map and when the user hovers over a course in the course catalog (highlights what room that class is in)
[ ] When hovering over a room, display what course it contains and what teacher belongs in it somewhere on the screen idk

QUESTIONS ------------------------------------

Q: It says that Honors Chemistry Integrated is a flex credit to a 3rd year science, when the course itself is a third year science. Because of this, if you take Honors Chemistry Integrated during your fourth year, can you take whatever you want your third year in place of science?
A: 

Q: CONC Physical Education and CONC Health are both listed as 1 credit, but are only a semester long. Should this be the case?
A: 

Q: What does it mean for something to count as a fourth-year math after algebra 2? Does it mean it only counts as a fourth year math IF it comes after an Algebra 2 class?
A:
